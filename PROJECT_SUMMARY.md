## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **User Query** → Web Interface (Flask)
2. **Query Processing** → Team Agent (aiXplain)
3. **Agent Routing:**
   - Historical questions → RAG Agent → Vector Database (ChromaDB)
   - Recent updates → API Agent → Federal Register API
   - New content → Scraper Agent → Web Scraping
4. **Response Synthesis** → Team Agent
5. **Formatted Answer** → Web Interface → User

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Platform** | aiXplain SDK | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **Vector Database** | ChromaDB | Semantic search and retrieval |
| **Web Framework** | Flask | User interface and API endpoints |
| **Document Processing** | Python (xml.etree) | CFR XML parsing |
| **Web Scraping** | BeautifulSoup | Content extraction from URLs |
| **API Integration** | Requests | Federal Register API client |
| **Embeddings** | ChromaDB default (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | Text vectorization |
